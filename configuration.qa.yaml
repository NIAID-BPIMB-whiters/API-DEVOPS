# SOAP/WSDL API MANAGEMENT NOTES
# =============================================================================
# Microsoft has documented that the current version of Azure APIops (v6.0.2) 
# does NOT support SOAP/WSDL APIs for automated deployment via publisher tool.
# 
# WSDL APIs must be deployed and managed manually through the Azure Portal.
# 
# For future SOAP API management:
# - Deploy manually through Azure Portal APIM interface
# - Do not add SOAP/WSDL specification files to this repository
# - APIops will ignore any manually deployed SOAP APIs in the portal
# =============================================================================
